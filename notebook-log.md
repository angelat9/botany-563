# Project Data #

I will conducting computational analyses to analyze homologous proteins 
across transposon insertion sequencing studies. The organism that I will 
studying are *Gram-negative* and *Gram-positive* bacteria. The reason 
behind studying those kinds of bacteria are that they show a frequent 
threat in medicine as half of these bacteria are resistant to 
antibiotic. But, for the purpose of the study, I will be looking the 
fluorescence activity accross the different baterias and see the 
similarity accross them.

Some bacterias are: *Vibrio fischeri*, *Acinetobacter baumanii*, *Vibrio 
cholerae*, *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*, *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, 
*Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Staphylococcus aureus* and many others.
